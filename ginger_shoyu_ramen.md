##Ginger shoyu ramen##

- 2-3 pounds pork neck bones (or chicken pieces or beef bones)
- 1 medium ham hock
- 1 head garlic, cloves peeled
- 1 medium white onion, peeled and halved
- 4 inch knob of ginger (or so). Err on the side of more ginger. Peeled and roughly chopped
- 2 4 inch squares kombu
- 3 packets bonito (about 1/3 cup?)
- Light soy sauce
- Mirin
- Sake
- Salt

1. Boil the bones and ham hock for 10-20 minutes, until they are not releasing much scum.
2. Drain and rinse the bones/hock, add them to a clean stockpot with the garlic, onion, and ginger. Bring to a boil then reduce to a low simmer.
3. Simmer at least four hours, skimming frequently. If you're cooking more than 4 hours, add a few cups of dashi (see below) if the liquid is getting too low (if you're planning on simmering 8-10 hours, make a little extra dashi). Don't stir the stock as it cooks, to prevent clouding.
4. Meanwhile, make the dashi. Soak the kombu in a medium saucepan in 2-3 quarts water for 30 minutes.
5. Over medium heat, bring the kombu to a low simmer. Then remove the kombu and boil on high for 5-6 minutes.
6. Reduce heat to low and add bonito, simmer, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes.
7. Strain dashi and set aside
8. When meat stock is done, strain (without pressing on solids), then combine with dashi to taste (I think I did 1:1)
9. Make the tare from 2:1:1 soy:mirin:sake, season the stock to taste. As you season, if the stock's in danger of being overpowered by the soy flavor, switch to seasoning with salt.
10. Cool stock in fridge, skim fat that rises to the surface. Reheat and serve.


Serve with whatever fixin's you like. Goes quite nicely with some topping that incorporates chinese black vinegar. Could be crunchy veggie quick pickled (chayote was good), or pickle soft boiled eggs in black vinegar, or incorporate it and ginger in a meat preparation (braised pork belly or meatballs or something). Also more ginger (pickled ginger or ginger flavored pickles) would be nice. Scallions duh.
