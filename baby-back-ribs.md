## Electric smoker, 9/7/2015, trial 1
Preheat smoker to 275. Place water pan in bottom of smoker, load wood chips, and place 1 metal rack in the smoker for each rack of ribs you are preparing.

**Every 30 minutes or so, add more wood chips to keep the smoke going (less important while ribs are wrapped).**

Trim the ribs. Remove any large chunks of fat (especially harder fat), or stray pieces of meat. If you like, peel off the silver skin membrane from the bone side of the rack. Even if you can't pull off the whole membrane, trim any loose or easy to remove pieces of connective tissue or membrane.

Rub a tiny bit of oil onto both sides of the ribs, to make the spice mixture stick. Mix all the spices together in a container (ideally with a shaker top, like an empty spice container) and dust the ribs as evenly as possible, on both sides. Pat the rub into the meat.

Place one rack of ribs on each rack in the smoker, meat side up

Cook for one hour, then (as quickly as possible) open the smoker and squirt whatever meat you can reach generously with the spray bottle. Basically any time you open the smoker (which shouldn't be too often! I opened it maybe 5 times the whole cook?), you should spray the meat (unless it's wrapped).

Cook for one more hour, then (one at a time), wrap them:
	- Lay four layers of foil on the counter (or two layers of heavy duty foil).
	- Spray the foil generously with the spray bottle, then pour on a healthy layer of bbq sauce (about the length of the rack).
	- Place the ribs on the sauce mixture, meat side down.
	- Spray the bone side of the ribs, and pour on more bbq sauce (all told I used about 1/3 of the bottle per rack, in these steps).
	- Wrap tightly in foil (you may need a few more sheets on the bone side) and place back in the smoker, rotating the positions of the racks.
	- I did it meat side down, again, since I only had a little foil on the bone side and didn't want to scrape it on the metal rack. Next time would probably wrap bone side with more foil and cook bone side down.

Cook unperturbed for two hours.

Unwrap each rack. I just removed the top layers of foil and kept the pouches in there, unrotated. I worried that if I removed them from the foil entirely they'd stick to the racks, and/or be very difficult to remove. This is about getting a little more smoke flavor in there, but more importantly getting a nice bark, sticky but not goopy.

Spray with the spray bottle, and cook for 30-90 mins more. Any time you open the smoker to check on them, give them a spray (unless they are done, in which case you should pull them out unsprayed). Don't check too often, as you'll lose a lot of heat. I thought they were done when the meat had a nice give to it, but it wasn't falling off the bone (I liked that the bones came out clean, but you could still pick up a rib and not just pull the bone straight out).

Put the rib pouches on the counter. If there are any pools of fat, gently soak them up with a paper towel. Cover loosely with foil and let rest ~15 minutes.

Remove all the foil and slice with a sharp knife. I cut into 2-bone portions.

Devour.
